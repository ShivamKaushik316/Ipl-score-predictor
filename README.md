# Ipl-score-predictor
This is a IPL Score Predictor using Linear Regression , K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor,  XGBoost Regressor , RandomForest Regressor ,  SVR ,  Decision Tree Regressor. In this project, the dataset was passed through all the above models out of which RandomForest Regressor performed the best .Hence to minimize the lines of code , only random forest regressor is used <br>
